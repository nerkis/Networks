A multithreaded web server that displays the browser's HTTP request message as well as response messages. To run the server and view messages, use terminal to navigate to the erkisPA2 folder, compile WebServer.java (javac Webserver.java) and then run WebServer (java Webserver). Open a browser and type in: <http://139.140.214.220.local:5020/> (replace IP address and port number as necessary). To view response messages that are not 404 Not Found, view the test.html file by typing <http://139.140.214.220.local:5020/test.html>.
